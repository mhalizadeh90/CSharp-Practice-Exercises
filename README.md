# CSharp-Practice-Exercises

This repository contains my solutions to various C# practice exercises. Each exercise is implemented as a separate console application. Below is a list of the exercises and their descriptions:

**1. ReverseStringCasing:**
   Write a method that takes an input string and returns a string with its casing reversed (**Note**: Avoid using Linq). For example:
   - Input: Happy Birthday
   - Output: hAPPY bIRTHDAY

**2. ReverseNumber:**
   Write a method that takes an input integer and returns an integer with its digits reversed (**Note**: Avoid using Linq). For example:
   - Input: 12345
   - Output: 54321

**3. DependencyInjection:**
   Implement an application using the Dependency Injection design pattern. You can follow the tutorial [here](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/dependency-injection-in-net-co-understanding-the-fundamentals-and-best-pract/).

**4. FactoryPattern:**
   Implement an application using the factory pattern. You can follow the tutorial [here](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/factory-design-pattern-csharp/).

**5. AbstractFactoryPattern:**
   Implement an application using the abstract factory pattern. You can follow the tutorial [here](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/abstract-factory-design-pattern-csharp/).

**6. FactoryMethodPattern:**
   Implement the Factory Method design pattern in an application. You can follow the tutorial [here](https://www.csharptutorial.net/csharp-design-patterns/csharp-factory-method/).

# Branching Conventions

In this project, we follow specific branch naming conventions to keep our repository organized and to make it easier to understand the purpose of each branch. Below are the main branch types we use:

1. **Feature/[feature-name]**: Branches created for implementing new features or functionalities.

2. **Fix/[issue-number]**: Branches dedicated to addressing specific bugs or issues. The issue or bug number is included in the branch name for easy reference.

3. **Update/[target]**: Branches for updating or modifying specific parts of the codebase.

4. **Refactor/[target]**: Branches focusing on code refactoring or restructuring to improve code quality without changing functionality.

5. **Docs/[target]**: Branches related to documentation changes or updates.

6. **Test/[target]**: Branches specifically dedicated to writing or updating tests.

7. **Chore/[task-name]**: Branches for non-code related tasks, like build configuration, tooling updates, etc.
