# CSharp-Practice-Exercises

This repository contains my solutions to various C# practice exercises. Each exercise is implemented as a separate console application. Below is a list of the exercises and their descriptions:

**1. ReverseStringCasing:**
   Write a method that takes an input string and returns a string with its casing reversed (**Note**: Avoid using Linq). For example:
   - Input: Happy Birthday
   - Output: hAPPY bIRTHDAY

**2. ReverseNumber:**
   Write a method that takes an input integer and returns an integer with its digits reversed (**Note**: Avoid using Linq). For example:
   - Input: 12345
   - Output: 54321

**3. DependencyInjection:**
   Implement an application using the Dependency Injection design pattern. You can follow the tutorial [here](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/dependency-injection-in-net-co-understanding-the-fundamentals-and-best-pract/).

**4. FactoryPattern:**
   Implement an application using the factory pattern. You can follow the tutorial [here](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/factory-design-pattern-csharp/).

**5. AbstractFactoryPattern:**
   Implement an application using the abstract factory pattern. You can follow the tutorial [here](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/abstract-factory-design-pattern-csharp/).
